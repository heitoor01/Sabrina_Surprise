# A Quiet Letter

This project is a personal tribute — a digital letter built quietly in one day, filled with reflection, gratitude, and the soft echoes of real emotion.  
It was created with HTML, CSS, and a lot of heart.

## 🌸 Purpose

This website was made to honor a moment in my life, and someone who helped shape it — maybe without even knowing.  
It holds my thoughts, memories, favorite books, a playlist, and two open-hearted letters.  

It isn’t a portfolio.  
It’s not a resume.  
It’s a moment. A message. A thank-you.

## 🧠 Creator's Note

This was built in a single day, but it holds years' worth of feeling.  
Even if no one ever reads it beyond the person it was made for… it was worth it.
