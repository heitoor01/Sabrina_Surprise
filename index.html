                I don't know if you'll read this. <br>
                I don't even know if you'll remember me a year from now. <br>
                But I built this little space anyway. Not to ask, not to impress, but to say... thank you. <br>
                You made my year lighter. I just wanted to leave something behind.

                Before you, I didn't really believe I could fall in love with a book. But then, one random mention
                turned into a quiet obsession. And nowâ€¦ reading feels like a piece of you I get to carry forward.

                            <strong>Divine Rivals</strong> became more than a book for me. It became a memory â€” one of
                            the best memories I could ever have... you. <br>
                            This book is my favorite, and it will probably stay at the top forever.
                            Not only because of the story, but because it will always remind me of you.
