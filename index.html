            <p class="letter">
                Dear Sabrina,<br><br>

                I don't know how you see me.<br>
                I don't know what‚Äîif anything‚Äîcrosses your mind when you think about me.<br>
                I've often wondered: did my presence ever make a difference to your day? Or was I just another student,
                one more name among many?<br><br>

                The truth is, I'll never really know.<br>
                I can't read your thoughts. I can't ask those questions out loud.<br>
                But I do know this: what I felt for you was something I've never felt before.<br><br>

                It wasn't just admiration.<br>
                It wasn't just a crush.<br>
                It was this quiet, slow-burning warmth that settled in my chest every time I saw you smile, or heard you
                speak, or watched you laugh at something small.<br>
                It felt‚Ä¶ safe. New. Real.<br><br>

                I think a part of me was just drawn to your light ‚Äî to the way you brought calm into the room without
                even trying.<br>
                And maybe it was one-sided. Maybe I noticed you more than you ever noticed me.<br>
                But that's okay.<br><br>

                I still wish I could be closer to you.<br>
                To talk more. To know the things that make you laugh when no one's around.<br>
                To be the kind of friend you could count on, not just a quiet presence in the back of a classroom.<br>
                But sometimes, I wonder if our lives are just too different.<br>
                And that hurts in a way I don't know how to explain.<br><br>

                Maybe I'm overthinking. I do that a lot.<br>
                But I also know how rare it is to feel something this honest for someone ‚Äî and I would've regretted it
                forever if I didn't at least try to say it.<br><br>

                You were a light for me in a season where I really needed something to hold on to.<br>
                Even if you didn't know it, even if you never intended to be‚Ä¶<br>
                You helped me without ever realizing it.<br><br>

                And that's why, above everything else, I just want to say thank you.<br>
                For existing exactly the way you are.<br>
                For being kind.<br>
                For being present during a time in my life that would've been so much darker without you in it.<br>

                With all the sincerity I have to give, <br><br>

            <h2 class="letterTitle">Second Letter - ‚ÄúMaybe, One Day‚Äù</h2>
            <p class="letter">
                Dear Sabrina, <br><br>

                This letter isn't meant to be heavy, okay?<br>
                I'm not here to ask for anything or to make you feel uncomfortable in any way.<br>
                I just wanted to share a few words I never had the chance ‚Äî or maybe the courage ‚Äî to say when it
                mattered most.<br><br>

                You were important to me.<br>
                Not in a loud, over-the-top way. Just quietly, steadily.<br>
                Your presence brought a sense of calm to my days, and even though we didn't talk much, you still became
                someone I admired deeply.<br><br>

                There was something about you ‚Äî your kindness, your patience, the way you carried yourself ‚Äî that made
                me feel like things could be better. Like maybe I could be better too.<br><br>

                What I felt wasn't dramatic or romantic in the way stories usually tell it.<br>
                It was something softer, something that made me smile silently, that made ordinary moments feel a little
                more special just because you were part of them.<br><br>

                I still don't know what you think of me. Maybe I was just a quiet student who stayed in the
                background. And if that's all I ever was, that's okay.<br>
                But I hope I was someone you wouldn't mind calling a friend someday.<br><br>

                I would love that ‚Äî to know you more, to share small conversations, to be part of your world in some
                quiet, honest way.<br>
                And if that never happens, I'll still be grateful. Because you were exactly what I needed in a moment I
                didn't know how to explain.<br><br>

                This isn't a goodbye, not really.<br>
                It's just a soft way of letting go of the pressure in my heart, while leaving the door open ‚Äî if life
                ever lets our paths cross again, I hope it's in a way that feels light, kind, and natural.<br><br>

                Thank you for being you.<br>
                For showing up.<br>
                For existing during a time I needed to believe that good people still do.<br><br>

                And if we ever talk again ‚Äî as friends, or whatever life has in store ‚Äî just know I'll be glad to hear
                from you.<br><br>

                I love you. <br><br>
